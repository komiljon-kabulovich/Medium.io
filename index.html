        I Asked Generative AI Music Platform Suno to Write a Podcast
        Theme…Things Got Weird

        In my last piece
        <u>“The Transparent Artist: Music in the Age of AI Disassembly”</u> I
        explore the threats AI tools, and generative AI music pose not only for
        artist but for society.
        <mark
          >A reader left a comment and asked if I had tried <u>Suno.ai</u> which
          is a music making generative AI engine. I had not, so I headed over to
          Suno to check it out.</mark

      <p id="l2">From Suno.ai’s about us page:</p>
      <p id="l3">
        Suno is building a future where anyone can make great music. Whether
        you’re a shower singer or a charting artist, we break barriers between
        you and the song you dream of making. No instrument needed, just
        imagination. From your mind to music.
      </p>
      <p id="l4">
        I am inclined to write a 3,000 word think piece just on that, but I’ll
        spare you for now and focus on my original intent: asking Suno to make
        me a theme song for a hypothetical podcast - a technology podcast by two
        Silicon Valley dudes in their 20s - and analyze the result.
      </p>
      <p id="l5">
        Before we dive in, I read Suno’s
        <a href="#" class="link1">terms of service</a>, and
        <a href="#" class="link2">created a pro account</a> so I could have the
        ability to share this song with you as we explore it’s weirdness.

        Inspired by an episode of the podcast Candy Ears titled “AI Experiment
        #4: Theme Songs with Charlie Harding,” where they created hypothetical
        podcasts and had Suno generate theme songs, I decided to conduct my own
        experiment. In the Candy Ears episode, Charlie Harding provided a
        critique of each AI-generated song. Following a similar framework, I
        created a hypothetical podcast and asked Suno to compose a theme song.
        Here’s what I came up with:
      </p>
      <p class="n1">Unplugged Minds</p>
      <p class="n2">
        The prompt: A 30 second theme song for a technology podcast by two
        Silicon Valley dudes in their 20's.
